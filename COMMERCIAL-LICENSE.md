# Commercial License Terms (OCR Arcade)

This document describes how to obtain a commercial license for OCR Arcade.

## Why a Commercial License Exists

OCR Arcade is available under `AGPL-3.0-or-later` by default.  
If your use case cannot satisfy AGPL obligations, you need a separate commercial license.

## Typical Scenarios That Require Commercial Licensing

You likely need a commercial license if you plan to:

- Offer OCR Arcade functionality in a closed-source SaaS product.
- Embed OCR Arcade into proprietary software or SDKs.
- Ship OEM / white-label builds without releasing complete corresponding source.
- Modify OCR Arcade and keep those modifications private while serving users over a network.

## Typical Scenarios That Do Not Require Commercial Licensing

You generally do not need a commercial license if you:

- Use OCR Arcade internally while complying with AGPL requirements.
- Distribute or host AGPL-compliant source, including your modifications, as required.
